Project: E-Commerce Platform API with Spring Boot

Description:
Developed a robust and scalable backend API for an E-Commerce platform using Spring Boot and Java. The API provided essential functionalities for product management, user authentication, shopping cart, and order processing.

Technologies Used:
- Spring Boot
- Java
- Hibernate (ORM)
- MySQL
- Spring Security (JWT-based authentication)

Key Contributions:
- Designed and implemented RESTful API endpoints for seamless interaction with the E-Commerce platform.
- Developed user authentication and registration mechanisms using Spring Security with JWT for enhanced security.
- Created API endpoints to manage product listing, retrieval, and dynamic product filtering to facilitate an intuitive shopping experience for users.
- Implemented shopping cart functionalities, allowing users to add, update, and remove items from their cart in real-time.
- Integrated secure payment gateways (e.g., PayPal, Stripe) to handle smooth and secure payment transactions.
- Designed the database schema and utilized Hibernate for ORM mapping to store product information, user details, and order history.
- Conducted comprehensive testing using JUnit and Mockito to ensure the reliability and functionality of the API.
- Prioritized data validation and proper error handling to maintain data integrity and enhance the API's robustness.
- Optimized API performance through caching strategies, resulting in reduced response times for high-traffic scenarios.
- Ensured adherence to RESTful API design principles, providing JSON responses and appropriate HTTP methods for API interactions.
- Created clear and comprehensive API documentation to ease integration for front-end developers and stakeholders.
- Addressed security considerations, including input validation and SQL injection prevention, to safeguard the API against potential vulnerabilities.
- Utilized Git for version control, enabling effective collaboration with the development team and tracking code changes efficiently.

Results:
- Successfully delivered a high-performance and secure API, contributing to the seamless operation of the E-Commerce platform.
- Improved user engagement and shopping experience through efficient product listing and real-time shopping cart updates.
- Received positive feedback from the development team and project stakeholders for timely delivery and code quality.
- Contributed to the growth and success of the E-Commerce platform, facilitating increased revenue and customer satisfaction.
